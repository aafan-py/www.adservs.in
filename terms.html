            split into smaller

            We at AdServs act as a facilitator for SMS services and provide a web-based A2P (Application-to-Person) SMS
            solution and HTTP APIs. Please note that we are not liable for any rules or regulations enforced by Telecom
            Operators or the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). All compliance requirements, including those
            for the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) regulations, must be managed and adhered to by the user.
            <h6>Important Disclaimers:</h6>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Compliance Responsibility:</strong> It is the sole responsibility of the user to ensure that
                their messaging content and templates comply with all applicable DLT and TRAI regulations. AdServs
                provides only a technical platform for sending SMS, and does not offer dedicated support or consultancy
                for DLT-related compliance.</li>
              <li><strong>No Liability for Regulatory Changes:</strong> Any changes in DLT regulations or operator
                policies that affect SMS delivery, template approval, or content scrubbing are beyond our control. Users

                campaigns.</li>
              <li><strong>Support Limitations:</strong> Our DLT support is provided as an additional, complimentary
                service to assist in complying with the regulations. However, we do not guarantee template approval or
                message delivery success under the DLT framework. AdServs will not be held responsible for any failures
                or rejections caused by operator-level compliance checks.</li>
              <li><strong>Operator Dependency:</strong> The SMS delivery is subject to inter-operator dependencies and
                DLT regulations, and AdServs cannot be held liable for any delays or failures caused due to
                operator-side issues.</li>
